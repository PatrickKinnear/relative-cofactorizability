  abstract = {Brugui`eres, Lack and Virelizier have recently obtained a vast generalization of Sweedler's Fundamental Theorem of Hopf modules, in which the role of the Hopf algebra is played by a bimonad. We present an extension of this result which involves, in addition to the bimonad, a comodule-monad and a algebra-comonoid over it. As an application we obtain a generalization of another classical theorem from the Hopf algebra literature, due to Schneider, which itself is an extension of Sweedler's result (to the setting of Hopf Galois extensions).},

Let in addition \$u\_\textbackslash ell\textbackslash subset U\_\textbackslash ell\$ be the corresponding "small" quantum group. In this paper we establish the following relation between the categories of representations of \$U\_\textbackslash ell\$ and \$u\_\textbackslash ell\$: We show that the category of \$u\_\textbackslash ell\$-modules is naturally equivalent to the category of \$U\_\textbackslash ell\$-modules, which have a \{\textbackslash it Hecke eigen-property\} with respect to representations lifted by means of the quantum Frobenius map \$U\_\textbackslash ell\textbackslash ti U(\textbackslash check g)\$, where \$g\$ is the Langlands dual Lie algebra. This description allows to express the regular linkage class in the category \$u\_\textbackslash ell\$-mod in terms of perverse sheaves on the affine flag variety with a Hecke eigen-property. Moreover, it can serve as a basis to the program to understand the connection between the category \$u\_\textbackslash ell\$-mod and the category of representations of the corresponding affine algebra at the critical level.},

We prove that fusion categories of nonzero global dimension are 3-dualizable, and therefore provide 3-dimensional 3-framed local field theories. We also show that all finite tensor categories are 2-dualizable, and yield categorified 2-dimensional 3-framed local field theories. On the other hand, topological properties of 3-framed manifolds determine algebraic equations among functors of tensor categories. We show that the 1-dimensional loop bordism, which exhibits a single full rotation, acts as the double dual autofunctor of a tensor category. We prove that the 2-dimensional belt-trick bordism, which unravels a double rotation, operates on any finite tensor category, and therefore supplies a trivialization of the quadruple dual. This approach produces a quadruple-dual theorem for suitably dualizable objects in any symmetric monoidal 3-category. There is furthermore a correspondence between algebraic structures on tensor categories and homotopy fixed point structures, which in turn provide structured field theories; we describe the expected connection between pivotal tensor categories and combed fixed point structures, and between spherical tensor categories and oriented fixed point structures.},

For such categories, balanced bimodules are defined using the formalism of balanced functors. The two main constructions are a relative tensor product of monoidal categories as well as a relative version of the monoidal center, which are Morita dual constructions. A general existence statement for a relative tensor products is derived from the existence of pseudo-colimits. In examples, a category of locally finite weight modules over a quantized enveloping algebra is equivalent to the relative monoidal center of modules over its Borel part. A similar result holds for small quantum groups, without restricting to locally finite weight modules. More generally, for modules over braided bialgebras, the relative center is shown to be equivalent to the category of braided Yetter-Drinfeld modules (or crossed modules). This category corresponds to modules over the braided Drinfeld double (or double bosonization) which are locally finite for the action of the dual.},

We show that our quantum groups can be identified with those of Creutzig-GainutdinovRunkel in type A1, and Gainutdinov-Lentner-Ohrmann in arbitrary Dynkin type. We discuss conjectural relations with vertex operator algebras at (1, p)central charge. For example, we explain how one can (conjecturally) employ known linear equivalences between the triplet vertex algebra and quantum sl2, in conjunction with a natural PSL2-action on quantum sl2 provided by our de-equivariantization construction, in order to deduce linear equivalences between ``extended'' quantum groups, the singlet vertex operator algebra, and the (1, p)-Virasoro logarithmic minimal model. We assume some restrictions on the order of our root of unity outside of type A1, which we intend to eliminate in a subsequent paper.},
