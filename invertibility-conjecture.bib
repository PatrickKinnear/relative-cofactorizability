  abstract = {We compute quantum character varieties of arbitrary closed surfaces with boundaries and marked points. These are categorical invariants \$\textbackslash int\_S\textbackslash mathcal A\$ of a surface \$S\$, determined by the choice of a braided tensor category \$\textbackslash mathcal A\$, and computed via factorization homology. We identify the algebraic data governing marked points and boundary components with the notion of a \{\textbackslash em braided module category\} for \$\textbackslash mathcal A\$, and we describe braided module categories with a generator in terms of certain explicit algebra homomorphisms called \{\textbackslash em quantum moment maps\}. We then show that the quantum character variety of a decorated surface is obtained from that of the corresponding punctured surface as a quantum Hamiltonian reduction. Characters of braided \$\textbackslash mathcal A\$-modules are objects of the torus category \$\textbackslash int\_\{T\^2\}\textbackslash mathcal A\$. We initiate a theory of character sheaves for quantum groups by identifying the torus integral of \$\textbackslash mathcal A=\textbackslash operatorname\{Rep\_q\} G\$ with the category \$\textbackslash mathcal D\_q(G/G)-\textbackslash operatorname\{mod\}\$ of equivariant quantum \$\textbackslash mathcal D\$-modules. When \$G=GL\_n\$, we relate the mirabolic version of this category to the representations of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) \$\textbackslash mathbb\{SH\}\_\{q,t\}\$.},

  abstract = {We study the question of dualizability in higher Morita categories of locally presentable tensor categories and braided tensor categories. Our main results are that the 3-category of rigid tensor categories with enough compact projectives is 2-dualizable, that the 4-category of rigid braided tensor categories with enough compact projectives is 3-dualizable, and that (in characteristic zero) the 4-category of braided fusion categories is 4-dualizable. Via the cobordism hypothesis, this produces respectively 2, 3 and 4-dimensional framed local topological field theories. In particular, we produce a framed 3-dimensional local TFT attached to the category of representations of a quantum group at any value of q.},

  abstract = {We prove that a finite braided tensor category A is invertible in the Morita 4category BrTens of braided tensor categories if, and only if, it is non-degenerate. This includes the case of semisimple modular tensor categories, but also non-semisimple examples such as categories of representations of the small quantum group at good roots of unity. Via the cobordism hypothesis, we obtain new invertible 4-dimensional framed topological field theories, which we regard as a non-semisimple framed version of the Crane-Yetter-Kauffman invariants, after Freed\textendash Teleman and Walker's construction in the semisimple case. More generally, we characterize invertibility for E1- and E2algebras in an arbitrary symmetric monoidal {$\infty$}-category, and we conjecture a similar characterization of invertible En-algebras for any n. Finally, we propose the Picard group of BrTens as a generalization of the Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion categories, and pose a number of open questions about it.},

We prove Tannaka duality theorems for forgetful functors into the monoidal category of Harish-Chandra bimodules in terms of a slight modification of the notion of a bialgebroid. Moreover, we show that the standard dynamical quantum groups F (G) and Fq(G) are related to parabolic restriction functors for classical and quantum Harish-Chandra bimodules. Finally, we exhibit a natural Weyl symmetry of the parabolic restriction functor using Zhelobenko operators and show that it gives rise to the action of the dynamical Weyl group.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a theory of monoidal categories relative to a braided monoidal category, called augmented monoidal categories. For such categories, balanced bimodules are defined using the formalism of balanced functors. The two main constructions are a relative tensor product of monoidal categories as well as a relative version of the monoidal center, which are Morita dual constructions. A general existence statement for a relative tensor products is derived from the existence of pseudo-colimits. In examples, a category of locally finite weight modules over a quantized enveloping algebra is equivalent to the relative monoidal center of modules over its Borel part. A similar result holds for small quantum groups, without restricting to locally finite weight modules. More generally, for modules over braided bialgebras, the relative center is shown to be equivalent to the category of braided Yetter-Drinfeld modules (or crossed modules). This category corresponds to modules over the braided Drinfeld double (or double bosonization) which are locally finite for the action of the dual.},

  abstract = {We construct log-modular quantum groups at even order roots of unity, both as finite-dimensional ribbon quasi-Hopf algebras and as finite ribbon tensor categories, via a de-equivariantization procedure. The existence of such quantum groups had been predicted by certain conformal field theory considerations, but constructions had not appeared until recently. We show that our quantum groups can be identified with those of Creutzig-GainutdinovRunkel in type A1, and Gainutdinov-Lentner-Ohrmann in arbitrary Dynkin type. We discuss conjectural relations with vertex operator algebras at (1, p)central charge. For example, we explain how one can (conjecturally) employ known linear equivalences between the triplet vertex algebra and quantum sl2, in conjunction with a natural PSL2-action on quantum sl2 provided by our de-equivariantization construction, in order to deduce linear equivalences between ``extended'' quantum groups, the singlet vertex operator algebra, and the (1, p)-Virasoro logarithmic minimal model. We assume some restrictions on the order of our root of unity outside of type A1, which we intend to eliminate in a subsequent paper.},
